The service provided is 'image to pdf conversion'.

The folder CSL458-A1-2012CSB1024 contains two files: 1. Server.java and 2. Client.java
which serves as a server and a client respectively. The server file Server.java when run
creates a mutithreaded server using ServerSocket class of java. Multiple clients can connect
to it at the same time. I have used synchronous technique in the server code. 
When the Client.java file is run, users have to input the ip address of the server they are
trying to connect and after that the full name of the image file they want to convert into
pdf format.
Ex:- (When the Client code is run)
Enter the ip address of the server:
10.1.9.239
Enter the image file name:
tosend.jpg

Make sure that the image file is kept in the same directory in which the Client.java code has 
been put. The client will get back the pdf format of the iamge in the same directory named as
"received.pdf".
